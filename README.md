# movie trailer display

## what is it?
#### a simple program that allows a user to input information about favorite movies, then display poster art and play trailers through the preferred web browser.

## how does it work?
#### class Movies is defined in movies.py. individual movies can be added in the file movies_project.py, along with their poster art and trailer url. finally, movies_project.py calls the function open_movies_page  from fresh_tomatoes.py to render movie posters and enable opening the trailer url from the user's preferred web browser. 
## installation:
#### make sure to have the following files saved in the same folder:
...* fresh_tomatoes.py
...* movies.py
...* movies_project.py
#### you can enter your favorite movies as class instances in movies_project.py, like this:
##### your_movie = movies.Movie('title', 'trailer_url', 'storyline', 'poster_url')

## who is responsible for this??
